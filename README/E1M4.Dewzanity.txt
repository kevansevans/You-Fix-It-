Changes I've made:

- Polished unaligned textures and textures in general
- Tweaked monster/item spawns (i hate too much ammo in maps)
- Tweaked various areas
- Improved various areas
- Added 2.5 new rooms
- Made yellow key room secret a little more obvious (maybe???)
- Added more deathmatch spawns, and a plasma rifle for multiplayer

I've never tried fixing a level before, unless you count when I first started mapping, which was a big yikes. I've never fixed a level while
being decent. I've also never tried to imitate the style of the classic doom maps, so I hope I did alright.
