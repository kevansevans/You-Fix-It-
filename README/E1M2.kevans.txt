//E1M2 - By kevansevans

Hey thanks for reading!

This is the start of an experimental community mapping project where each mapper has to build on top
of the previous mappers work, and is free to do whatever. It was an interesting experience to look
at the famous E1M1 and try to "improve" upon it. On a technical level, how does one improve upon
something that famous? Well a lot of changes I focused on were turning E1M1 into a more "tutorial"
level.

This outlook comes from Tim Roger's review of Doom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38zduHkwGcc
Long long video aside, the part that drew my inspiration is where Tim cites E1M1 as being the level
that teaches players all of the mechanics Doom will use.

This is obviously false, there's so much not in E1M1 that you can still learn things as you play. 
So that was my goal, I aimed to fix this and make E1M1 teach players "most" of the mechanics. I
obviously couldn't do this for EVERYTHING, but I could get close without spoiling all of the games
surprises.

Plus some added details I guess.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
1) First major change I made was to show that geometry can change. Walking into the left room
will make the stairs raise and the upper platform accessible.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
2) The zig zag toxic pit is technically pointless. Unless you're a twit who chooses to stand in it,
movement through this room rarely results in the player getting damaged and not really
conveying it's a dangerous spot. I lowered the pit, because everyone knows pits are bad to fall into.
If the player were to fall off the edge, they'd learn about topxic floors and to find the elevator out.

3) To reenforce the idea that geometry could change, I thought it'd be cool to make the famous 
zig zag raise out of the ooze. So I spent a few minutes crafting a room adjacent to the mid
indoor room.

4) Keys at this point struck me. Adding the blue key was a bit tricky, and I wanted to make
it required in order to progress.

I knew I wanted it to be in that outside area. Romero has a famous rule, where if the player
can see outside, let them go outside. The spot I'm refering to is inaccessible in the vanilla wad,
so I aimed to fix that. This isn't where the blue key ended up, but on that later.

First problem that came up was accessing it. Originally it was a switch added to the south most tech 
pillar akin to the north one, but there was no real indicator you were supposed to be looking for it.

Second problem that arose was what door I wanted to lock. Originally I had the exit door locked with the
blue key. I later realized this might be a bit of a slap to the face, when the player gets all the way
to the end, only to find out they needed to back track.

After some thinking, I turned this into a small puzzle. While the key now is where the green armor used
to be, there's a whole platform missing! I added a very obvious door instead of a switch that makes the
out door area accessible, and following the path leads to a switch that raises a platform, making the key
accessible. I then made the door between the starting area and the mid-room the new blue lock, so if
players were a little too gun-ho about getting to the end, the blockade wouldn't feel as bad.

I shortly added the red key and locked door after to show the player that there's different locked doors.
I could have made it so it was just the red key, but that would have undone the fix that let the player
go outside, and I wanted to make sure that got noticed.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
5) One secret got a bit cleaned up. To teach the player that back tracking is sometimes needed, and that
more secrets than just the blue armor one exist, I gave a better hint that there's a room behind
where the two imps are. Where the player would observe this, the platform hadn't lowered yet, so their
first instinct to back track may leave them with the notion they haven't triggered the exact event yet.

I left alone the quick access to the blue armor. Initially I wanted to remove this one, but as I thought
about it, it works as a shortcut to bypass the key cards.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
6) The added secret I put in myself I took as oppourtunity to story tell a little. I made that ledge
accessible and sprinkled a few items to get the player to think a bit more about investigating.
I purposefully didn't flag the spot as a secret and hid the real secret behind a wall with small
visual hints. In the real secret, I put a dead pinky in it with a dead marine. I imagine people back 
in '93 would see this and wonder what it was, speculate on the fact that there's bigger demons to face.
